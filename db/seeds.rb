# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   Fruits = Fruit.create([{ name: 'Apple' }, { name: 'banana' }])
#   tree.create(name: 'Apple tree', fruit: fruits.first)
